        <p class="fact alltxt">AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. One AU is 92,955,807.3 miles or 149,597,870.7 kilometers.
            It takes light 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel one AU. This means that when you look outside, you are looking at light 8 minutes and 20 seconds ago.
            Basically, you are seeing old light. For example, lets say the star Betelgeuse just exploded. It would take us 600-700 years for us to see it explode because it is 600-700 light years away.

        <p class="fact alltxt">Light seconds, minutes, hours, and years are all based on the distance LIGHT can travel in that time period.
         So a light year is 5,878,625,373,183.6 mi(~6 trillion)* or 9,460,730,472,580.8 km(~10 trillion)*. 
         These numbers represent how far light can travel in a year.
        </p>
        <p class="fact alltxt" >A light second is 186,282 mi* or 299,792 km*.</p>
        <p class="fact alltxt" >A light minute is 11,176,943 mi* or 17,987,547 km*.</p>
        <p class="fact alltxt" >And finally, a light hour is 670,616,629 mi* or 1,079,252,848 km*.</p>
        <p class="fact alltxt" >The final set of measurements are parsecs, kilo parsecs, and mega parsecs.</p> 
            <p class="fact alltxt" >A parsec is 3.26 light years or 19,173,000,000,000,000 mi. </p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" > A kilo parsec is 3261.56 light years or 19,173,000,000,000,000,000 mi. </p>
             <p class="fact alltxt">And last, but DEFINITELY NOT least(seriously though), one megaparsec is 3,261,563.77697573 light years or 19,173,000,000,000,000,000,000 mi.</p>
             <p class="fact alltxt"><strong>WAIT!!!</strong> There is one more thing! Here is the order of the planets:Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
         <p class="note alltxt">*Note: All measurements that deal with light movement are accurate for light in a perfect vacuum. 
            In other substances, light moves just slightly slower.</p>

            <p class="fact alltxt" >Our Solar System is one of the sextillion(yes, this a number) star systems in the Universe.
                Most star systems are binary(two stars orbiting each other) or have more than two stars.
                We(obviously)have only one star, the Sun. Star systems are formed over millions of years.
                A dense cloud of hydrogen and dust collapse and swirl over a forming star.
                The leftover dust and gas creates an accretion disc(disc of dust and gas, black holes have these), 
                which is the starting the formation of the planets. After ~50-100 million years, the star system is fully formed.

            <p class="fact alltxt" >Right now, our solar system is about 4.6 BILLION years old.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >The Sun's mass is equal to about 330,000 Earths.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >960,000 Earths can fit in the Sun, but because Earth is a semi-perfect sphere, space will be left over.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >The Sun takes up 99.8% of all mass in the Solar System!</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Mercury is the closest to the Sun and has no atmosphere. Contrary to popular belief, Mercury is NOT the hottest planet in our Solar System.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >The hottest planet in the Solar System is Venus due to it's thick atmosphere which traps heat within the planet. Plus, the volcanic activity on Venus adds to the heat. Venus is ~460 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >All gas giants(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) have rings. Saturn just has the biggest and therefore, the most popular ones.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Some scientists and astronomers(and other space fields) say that if Jupiter was just a little bigger, it could become a dwarf star.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Mars used to have rivers and lakes, but over time Mars' atmosphere grew thin and the planet cooled, leaving only valleys, river paths, and polar ice caps.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >The martian dirt is so old that it is rusting(iron oxide)! This gives Mars its red color.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Saturn is less dense than water. This means that Saturn would float like a boat if we put it in a Saturn sized pool.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Uranus rotates on its side at a 98&deg; tilt.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Neptune has the fastest winds in the Solar System that can go up to 1,200 mph(kmh)</p>

            <h1 class="alltxt"><strong>Stars</strong></h1>
           
            <p class="fact alltxt" >A star is a giant nuclear fusion power plant. A star's core is so hot and dense it cause hydrogen atoms to fuse together to create heavier and heavier atoms. This will add on and on until it creates a atom that is too heavy for our star. This causes stars to collapse under its own mass creating, depending on the size/type, either a black hole, neutron star, or a white dwarf.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Our sun is a Main Sequence star. This means when our Sun is at the end of its life, it will swell so big, that it will consume all rocky planets(Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and then it will explode into a planetary nebula, obliterating all remaining planets, leaving only dust, rocks, and a White dwarf(will cool to a black dwarf in trillions of years). A White dwarf is the left over super-dense core of a Main Sequence star and a Red dwarf.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Red dwarfs are the most common and smallest star in the Milky Way. Red dwarfs live for trillions of years, so none have died yet. The reason why none have died is because the Universe is too young, only 13.6 billion years old.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Massive stars only live up to tens of millions of years due to their hydrogen consumption. Unlike the Sun, which doesn't fuse all the way to iron, massive stars do. Iron can't release energy from fusion. This causes the core to collapse and the outer layers explode into a supernova. At the end, a neutron star is left over.</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Very massive stars are the same as massive stars but the core is heavier, which results in a black hole(more about black holes and star remnants alike later).</p>
            <p class="fact alltxt" >Stars use mass-energy conversions, which is basically, E=mc<sup class="supmargin">2</sup>.</p>
